# BGA-Classification


This repository contains code to classify individuals based on an AIM set into populations. The code was built with TabPFN (https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn#-license), which has been published in Nature "Accurate predictions on small data with a tabular foundation model" by Hollmann et al.  <br>

This repsository contains <br>

- a jupyter notebook script to use TabPFN for classification of individuals into populations that can be downloaded. You just have to change the input paths to your test and training data. <br>
- an  Grafical User Interface to use TabPFN for classification of individuals into populations. <br> 
- Example Test and Trainingsdata  (data_test.csv, data_train.csv). This data is simulated. <br>
- the code that was used to prepare the data of our paper "Enhancing BGA Prediction with machine learning" <br>
- the code to plot the confusion matrices (plot_conufsion_matrix.py). <br>
